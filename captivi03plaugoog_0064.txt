PROSODY. lv

the iambus always begins with the beginning of a word,
but it may be made up of two words, with or without
elision‚ or of a monosyllable and the first syllable of a
succeeding word, or of the two first syllables of a poly-
syllabic word 3 (2) that the backward influenee is exercised
whether the ictus falls on a long syllable (v Δ) or on the
first of two equivalent short ones (ν-ὐν), and whether
the syllables concerned form one or two complete words
or part only ol a word or words.

148 The matter, then, may be summed up thus :—

When thearsis or thesis os a foot in an Iambic, Trochaic
or Anapaestic line consiste of two syllables which in ordi-
nary Prosody would form an iambus, the long syllable
(whether long by nature or position) is shortened by reason
of the ictas falling upon either the preceding or the follow·
ing syllable; when this happens in arei, ie. when the in-
fluence of the iotae is forwerd, the iambus always begins

with the beginning of a word; but when it happens in
thesi this is not always the casel.

¹ Prof. Tyrrell in his edition or the Miles states the matter
thum—“ln In words, or combinatione ol words, forming in
ordinary Prosody an iambus, if the nocent (or ictae mertem)
be on the first sylls, the long unaccented syll. is shortened
(2) In words or combinatione oi words similarly forming a
bacchius (vn), if the acoent (or ictas mnam) bs on the
third sylb, the second is shortened.” Το the wording οἶ
the first rnle no exception can be taken, for the ictuc ean
never fall on a short syllable unless the following syllable
is intended to be also short, the two together represent·
ing the long syllable which in the original or proper foot
of the measure would receive the ictas. But the wording of
the second mle is open to objection; the case, as so stated,
is for instance invariahle in cretics, without of course the
second syllable being shortened3 eg. in 239 Nom secundom
patrem, the word secondom forms a bacchius with the ictas on
