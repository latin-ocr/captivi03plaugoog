they will gulde young studente in scanning the linea,
and they will complete the general account in the
Introduction by pointing out the particular illustra-
tions to be found in the text of this play.

In writing the commentary I have made use of
all previous editions and have to* acknowledge my
indebtedness especially to those of Brix and Ussing.
I have tried to make the notes illustrate the grammar
and phraseology not merely of this play, but of
Ἴ Plautus as a whole, and with that object have quoted
more freely than I should otherwise have done from
the rest of the plays. Moreover I have attempted in
the notes to call attention to as many points as
possible-some of them may seem of minor importance
-believing that a better knowledge of the language
and more valuable habits of mind are acquired by

the thorough study of one work, or even of a portion
s of one work, than bytho hasty reading of half-a·
dozen.

The grammars to which I have referred are Roby's
Grammar of the Latia Lartqaayc and Kennedy’s Re-
oiscd Batia Primcr,· these are referred to as R. and
K, and quoted by sections. In the quotations from
other Plautiae plays the references are to Tyrrell’s l
Miles, Benoist's Cistellaria, Ussing's Mostellaria and
Persa, and in the case of the remainder to Ritschl's
new edition.
