so many others, by the addition of -cc- tcthestem. Ennius Ἴ

'Phe consonantal a (= ) was then absorbcd in the pre
oeding vowel a, which was thus lengthened, but 1100001100-
quently shortened again according to the general rule. In

Pl. we sometimes find it long; thus in 262 fidimus, 555 and

633 feld, in Mil. 1364 facim, Men. 63 plcerat.

134 We now come tc the chief difficulty in Plautina scan-
sion; numerous lambio, Trochaic and Anapaestic lines
occur in which 0 long syllable stands after a short one and

forms with it (as is evident from the scansion of the rest
01 the line) either the craia 01 the 1110111 01 0 1001. Now in

these measures neither areis nor 110011 can contain an
iambus3 the most that either 01 them can contain 10 one
