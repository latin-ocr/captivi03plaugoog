NOTES. 101

pauxillo. contentus essa: 11161166. have pauxillum e. e.
which can hardly mean ‘be contented with a little,' although
Uss. thinks it possible, comparing the use 61 thc acc. with
dignae. It can only mean ‘be 6 little contented' which makes
nonscnse 61 Erg’s answer 66 perp. modo. So we must either
emend pausillo and 6666666111), which is diffieult on account

’ 61 the repetition 61 the 666, 61 we must take 6661611166 esce

in the sense 61 ‘contentedly eat,' 6661661166 being used abso·
lutcly and adverbinlly; either 61 these uses might be paral-
leled by 116611, the former eg. by Poen. 460 (quoted 611 643),
the latter by Hor. Sat. 1. 1. 3,1. 4, 108, but the combination 61

them is very awkward.

177. tle perpauxillo modo=modo ce perp. (cl. Ter. Ad.

835 ete 61161661 modo), and modo ne=dummodo 66 ‘provided

that...not‚' cf. Cic. htt. v. 4. 3 quoe de Sicinio 6611611 66

'milii probantum modo 66 illa exceptio aliquem 16661161 bene
de 66116 meritum.

179-183 would come in better, as Sch. points out, after
190 11 183 were expunged. In 179 111661 editors have HE.
Ape 616 roga. ER. Emptum, 6161..., but the arrangement in
the text is that ol 11161166. and is retained by Urs. and Sch.
As the proposul comes from Erg. it 16116, and 1161 Heg.‚ who
would bc impetierit to settle the matter.

toga emptum=‘strilre 1116 bargain' lit. proposs 61 stipu-
late that the thing (Ergt‘s company) be bought. Rogare is
used 61 the person who ashs the formal question in a stipe-
16116 (see 611 898), and the phrase repere emptum occurs in the
Digest, xv111. 1. 41 cum ab eo qui fundum 6111 obligatum 16-
16161, guidem aie emptum 16966661, Somewhet analogous is
the phrase rogare 66166166, used 61 thc presiding magistrate
proposing to the comitia the names 61 candidates lor the
consulship. Ergasilus regards Hegio's dinner as the price ior
which he sells his own company (the usual view, 61, Sti. 171
where the parasite says 6666 61 ridiculum bominem quaerat
quispiam, 6666116 epo eum cum ornamentie metten also Sti.
195 and 220 sqq.) and wishes Hegio 16 striks the bargain by
lormal question (as in Ep. 471 Estne empto 6111116116 legibus?
PE. Habeat licet); but he remembers that homey yet get
abetter invitation, and adds, as an aiterthought, n.iet...me9ie
‘on condition that I do not get a better offer¹; this was not
an unusual condition in an agreement for sale, especially in
the case oi land: cl. Dig. 111112. 11116 fundumentum 6616
tibi emptum, 616161661616166 Kal. Jac. proximet meliorem
condicionem seretti.
