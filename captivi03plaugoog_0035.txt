4th lt was usually written in systema, consisting of a
number of dimeters with an occasional monome'ter, the
whole ending with a catalectic verse, usually a dimeter,
called Parosmbc, because it often contained a proverbial
saying (παροιμία) ¹. in these systems the scansion was
continuous throughout, so that the last syllable of a line
was subject to the ordinary mles of prosody except at the
end of a sentence or any marked pause in the sense.

58 Two dimeters occur in this play, 498, 500, but the
Romans generally preferred to write them, like the iambic
and trochaic‚'in double measure as tetrameters‚ concluding
the set with a septenarius or shorter catalectic line ; eg.
Aul. ua sqq. These octonarii are govemed by the same
mles as the septenarii.

scattered lines, is sometimes considered as arising from
an iambus being prefixed to cretics, and certainly the cata·
lectio lines may be so scanned (ξ 63), but the acatalectic
lines, whatevertheir origin, maybemoreconvenientlytaken
