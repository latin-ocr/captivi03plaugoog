action.
12 Aristophontes of course at once lets the cat out of
1, iv, the bag by addressing him as Tyndarus and, unable to
think of any better plan, Tyndarus boldly asseris that
Aristophontes is a dangerous madman and advises Hegio
not to go near him. This ct first creatos a diversion, ior
Aristophontes flies into such a passion as almost to bear
out Tyndarus' statement, but soon the behaviour of Tyn·
derus, who is trying to make signs to Aristophontes

hear what Aristophontes has to say. When, in proof of
his assertion that Tyndams is an impostor, Aristophontes
proceeds to describe the real Philocrates, Hegio recognises
the description at once, and seeing how he has been
deceived summons the slave-overseers and orders them to
bind Tyndarus hand and scot,
13 Tyndarus then gives up the game and admits the

strain than is usual in Roman eomedy; his first duty, he
says, was to his young master with whom he had lived all

and if he must die he will die in the consciousness of
having done what he ought. This lofty tone does not tend
to conciliate Hegio, who sends him off to lahour in the
stonsquerries with orders that his life is to be made a
burden to him. Then it is that Aristophontes understands

the more so as Hegio, on whose good humour he had
