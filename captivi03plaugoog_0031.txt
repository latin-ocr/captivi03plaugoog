The anapaest is never put after a tribraoh or daetyl and
is used less often in the even than in the odd feet, while
neither anapaest nor tribrech is frequent in the 4th; in-
deed trisyllabis feet generally ere more sparingly used than
in senarii.

At the end of the 4th foot there is a division of the
verse, called in this instance diaeresis (διαίρεσις ‘division’);
the ah foot should consequently end with the end of a
word, but the rule is often neglected.

49 The praetiosos Pl. differs from that of the Greeks in the

following points :- ⁹

(i) He admits spondes and daotyl in ind and 6th; in
veh he admits spondes end occasionelly tribreoh end deotyl,
very rarely anapaest.

(ii) He admits proceleusmatie rarely in lst and very
rerely in the other odd feet1.

(iii) On the other hand, in observing the diaeresis he is
more striet than the Greeks, neglecting it only once in

about every seventy lines ; indeed this division seems to be
regarded almost as the end of a verse, the iambus (which

alone, with very rare exceptions‚ is allowed in 4th) being

sometimes replaced by a pyrrhic, while hiatus is frequent
(ξ 84). Thus the Plautine scheme is
