908. pendent indemnatae peraeta, ior causta or 1111161,
aninstance 61 ἀπροσδόκητον. There isaplay on the word pendeo
which is used 61 persons or things that are ‘in suspense‚’ as
in Verg. Aen. rv. 88 pendeat opera interrupta. Iademaatae
caueae: ‘undecided actiona’ (tio. Reb. Post. 4 6611616116616 ·

The division 61 Latin comedies into Acts was known to
Varro and Cic. (Verr. 11. 6. 18, Q. F. 1. 1. 16) and to Hor. (A.
P. 189 neae 1611161161 eit quinto productior acta Fabula) but
was probably unknown to Pl. or Ter. Thenas. divide only
into scenos, and the plays were probably acted straight on,
without any interval. Where, however, a character leaves the
stage at the end of a scene and 16611616 61 the beginning 61
the nont, or where, 161 any other reason, some space 61 time
must elapso between two consecutive soenes, the interval was
filled up by musio 116111 the tibicen: 61. Ρ6. 573 tibicen aaa
interea 1116 delectanter-it. Whoevor dividcd 1116 Captiui into
Acts would have done better to make the 5th begin with this
sceno, before which an interval is necessary, rather than with
the nent, as in the 1166.

909. DiespiterzDies Pater, an old name 161 1616; ei.

Iuppiter (deotpato). The words dies diurnas diuos deae δῖος
Ζεύς Iouis (old form Diouis) aro all connected, the common
idea being ‘brightnesa’ For Diespiter dique see on 818.

911. modo in: most editors retain these words and read
1161616616611161, 111111Βὸ1116; but this does not seem probable
in view 61 the 1166. readings and the singular verb aduenit. For
the aco. after 61666116, 61. Verg. Aen. a 388, Tyriam qai ad-
uenerie arbem, and note on 548. For intemperiae 61. Colum.

912. After this verse, parts 61 a line beginning with
naraonn and ending with 11111611 have been deoiphered
in A. The lact 61 116 having ended with the same word as
this verso would account ior its occidental omission.
