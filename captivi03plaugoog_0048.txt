‘ll This is the neglect in scansion of a final letter, other-
wise than by elision. The name is objectionable, as it
implies that the poets nutri ¹qratia cut off a letter which
was pronounced in ordinary speech 'rho contrary is the ,
fact; the early dramatists and poeta, in the peculiarities
noticed below, merely followed the popular pronunciation,
in which sounds were omitted or wedrened to a much
greatm extent than ever appeared in the written language:
this was due to the constant tendency, felt in all languages,
to reduce the affort of articulation.

92 The effect of this tendency upon final letters and
syllables is noticed in ξ 116; the two instances of it which
come under the head of Apocope are: ’

(1) 'Ibe interrogative particle cae, when added toa
word ending in a vowel, and followed by a word beginning
with a consonant, was probably pronounoed simply as π’,

at any rate in short sharp questions, and the early poets
frequwtly, and the later ones sometimes, followed this

general mage3 ag Verg. Aen. x11. 503 matca' placuit, 797

93 (2) Afinal a, in words ending inte cr ria, was in early
poetry frequently neglected before a consonant, the

linal syllable thus remaining short. Cicero, in speaking
of this usage1,menti0ns qnly the termination -aa, but cf.
