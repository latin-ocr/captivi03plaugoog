diphthong or lt, the final syllable of the former· word is
said to be elided, i.e must be onrittod in scanning; and
the neglect of this elision is called Hiatus '

82 The question when hiatus should be admitted in
Pl, and when its occurrence should make us suspect
corruption in the text, is one upon which scholaris have
differed greatly. Some, by alterations and insertione in
the text and the introductiones various archaio forms,
have succeeded in eradicating it almost entirely; but this
methodis certainly unscientific, because it is the text of
the Mss. which forms the main source of our knowledge
of the subject. The proper course is surely to classify all
the instances which are found in the MSS„ omitting those
which occur in lines otherwise suspicions or immetrical or
of which the scansion is doubtful; the probability of each
class will depend upon the number of undoubted instanoes
which it contains.

83 The Captiui contains 60 01 70 such instances, which
fall into three classes3 those which occur (A) at a divi-
sion of thereme, ο1(Β)111ρ111100111101111111110101110,
or which (0) 110 10 be justified by the form of the words

themselves.

84 A. Of the first class we may remark thet even in
the Augustun poets hiatus is sometimes found 11 the
caesura: eg.

Verg. Ecl. 111. 6 Et succus pecori} et lac subducitur nynia.

(1) Similariy in Ph hiatus is generally admitted at the
(1111010111 of tetrameters, eg.

Mil. 358 Quid att tu, Sceledre! S. Haucrdmyer05 1110100
atris, loquere quiduis (ium. sept). 01011110.
