change, he bought them both. '

quaestoribus, Roman allusion; it was part of the prouincia
(see on 156) of the quaestore to sell booty taken in war; cf.
Bac. 1075 nuuc huuc praedam omnemiamad quaestorem deserum.

35. uisendi-ce, old form of nom. pl. Afinal 1 in the
nom. pl. of ·o sterne of all kinds is frequently found in early

illue, ipsae, potia). Thus heic mqistreic uireia, etc, found in
early inscriptions, were replaced later on by bi maqistri uiri, etc.
Hisce is found in Ps. 539, Rud. 294, ete, illisce in Most.

as a slave to the father of Philocrates.
