been already pointed out in § 115. 'l'he other and better
view is that the long syllable ia to be slorteaeol and the

iambus scanned as a pyrrhic. Two explanatione of this
shortening have been given.

135 (i) The first is that the early dramatists sometimes
neglected the law of position. Now in the first place this
fails to explain the shortening of vowels long by natare,
a large proportion of the instances; and in the second
place, even with regard to vowels long by position it is no
explanation at all, but simply restates the difficulty. These
vowels are shown by the matre to be short, whereas by the
law of position they should be long; it is no explanation,
but only a paraphrase, to say that in such cases the law of
position is neglected. What is wanted is an explanation
why it is so, and why the natural length of other syllables
is neglected also.

136 (ii) The second explanation refers this shortening to
the influence of the ictio metrica (ξ 39); an influence
which the early drama inherited from the old Saturnian
Rhythm, butwhich disappeared with the complete adoption
cf the Greek methodos versification (cf. ξ 79). Now the
metrica] lotia, although a different thing from the natural
accam of a word, very generally coincides with it, and in-
deed takes its place in the rhythmical recitation of verse,
and it is therefore not unnatural to attributa tc the iata
in verse an effect similar to that produced by the ocean
in ordinary pronunciation. And the effect of aceenting a

syllable in ordinary speech is to throw the unaceented
syllables on each side ol it into the shade, as it were;

with the common result of weakening or shortening them
if long, and often causing them to disappear if short. The
following words¹ illustrate this effect of the secent, both
backwards and forwards t—o(o)litmor‚ discip(a)llna‚ par( l-

² Pelle, Gr. and Lat. Etym. p. 331. As to final syllables,
which were never weented in Latin, see ἐξ 116 sqq.
