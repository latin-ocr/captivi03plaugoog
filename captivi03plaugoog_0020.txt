THE MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUPUS xi

17 Hegio remeius behind to question Stalagmus ; with

v, fi, the greatest indifference and marg-froid this rascel tells
how he had stolen off with Hegio's younger son and sold
him into slavery at Elis. ‘To whoml’ asks Hegio. ‘To
Theodoromedes the father of Philocrates'

18 Hegio summons Philocrates from the house and it

r, fii then appears (as the spectators have known all along)
that the long-lost eon is no other than the faithful Tyn·
darus.

19 This is no sooner mede clear than Tyndarus himself

y, iv· appears, laden with letters and carrying the piek which
he has been using in the quarries. He begins describ
ing his sufferings there, when he is suddenly overwhelmed
with joy in recognising Philocrates; his real identity
isthen explained to him, but he takes some time to
grasp the wonderful news. A blacksmith is sent for
to transfer his felters to Stalagmus, and the play ends
with a short epilogue sung by the whole of the company.

THE MANUSORIPTS OF PLAUTUS.

20 In speaking of the manuscripts of Plautus e distinction
is drawn between the first eight plays and the last twelve;
hythe first eight plays one means the Amplilulo, Annam,
Aulidariu, Captivi, Casina, Cistellaria, Curculio and Epi-
dicus ; the last lwelve are the Bacchides, Menaechmi and
the rest. The alphabetical order which obteins (as far as
the initial letters are concerned) among the other plays is
dapar-ted fmm in the case of the Bacchides, doubtless
because il contains an allusion to the Epidcbua¹‚ to which
it was therefore subsequent in point of time.
