of their long syllables resolved; thus from the bacchius
(vu) ws get the nh paeon (vm) and the ind paeon
(mv), from the molossus (---) we get the ionic a
minori (vm), the choriambus (--=-) and the ionic a
majori (ων).

There is sometimes a diaeresis after the second bac·
chius, but it is often neglected, cf. Cap. rsa-789 ; when it
is observed, hiatus sometimes occurs, ci. ξ 84.

61 Dimeters acatalectio ars also found (cf. 503); according
to Seyffert they do not admit a molossus cr resolved
molossus in 2nd.

63 Cataleotic bacchiacs have an iambus instead of the
last bacchius, and, as above mentioned, may also be
scanned as cretius with an iambus prefixed. The form cf
the tetrameter is thus2-1-1--1-uv-1-1v7while the

¹ dimeter is the same as tha latter part of the tetrameter.
506, 507 contain four dimeters.

64 The trochaic septenarius, or catalectic tetrameter, was,
like the iambis septenarius, called aeram quadratas by the
Romans, of. Gell. 11. 29.

It probably arose from a cretio being prefixed to the
Iambic Senarius3 at any rate the caesura in the latter
corresponds to the diaeresis in the former, thus
