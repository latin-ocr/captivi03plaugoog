PROSODY.

79 ln noticing the points of differente between the
proscdyof Pl. and that of tha Augustan poete, there are
two things to be remembered: first, that in accordanoe
with the tendency of all languages to substitute essier·
sounds for more difficult, many syllables especially final
ones, which were originally long had been shortened by the
time of Augustus; and, seoonffly, that PL wrote when the
older saturniae verse, which was based upon cadence or
rhythm‚ hed been but recently replaced by the Greek me·
trioal system founded upon quantity. We are therefore
prepared to find (1) that socelled ‘licences' cr departures
from the strici rules of this system, which are found even
in the Augustan poets, occur much¹ more freely in P1.‚(r)
that certain terminatione and other syllables, short in
later writers, are used by Pl. with their original long quan-

Ι tity‚ and (3) thet accent, which had been supreme in the
old Saturnian measure, is sometimes allowed by Pl. to
override the quantity of a syllable as fixed by the Greek

metricat system, in which of courseaccent has properly no

pleae. ’

80 The first class cf peculiarities, those socelled licences
which may be to some extent paralleled in the classicel

pects, fall under three heeds, Hiatus, Apooope and Con-
traction. ·
