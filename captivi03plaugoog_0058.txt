PROSODY. xlix

126 -be‘ca in the dative plural is sometimes long in Pl. (see
Peile p. 325), eg. Mero. 900 01110170. aaa probat, Rud.
975 omnibu adcanto.

127 -es in nom. of 3rd decl, with gen. in 11111111, ldis, is
short in Aiigirstan poets; but even they make exceptions,
ag. arabs, abita, paries. In the early language it was long,
in compensation for the loss of the stem dental, and the
original quantity is perhaps found in Pl, e. g. Aulula 011101
impransus, As. 330 tum tyifur 10 diues ea factus.

128 aa from aaut is always long in Pl and Ter. (R. 260);
eg. lines 333, 412, 427, 837, 860 of this play. Being an
unemphatic word, it was afterwards shortened contrary to
the general rule with monosyllables, and iu the Augustan
poets is always short.

syllables originally long were afterwards shortened in ae-
cordance with the general rule in Latin theta vowel,
standing before another vowel 0r diphthong and forming
a separate syllable, is short.

130 Jto: here the a' was long hy nature, and is found so in
the Augustan poeta except in fit (supra 1 191), in the
imperfect subjunctive erraa ete, and in the infinitiva
steri Some of these lbrms could not have been used at
all in Dactylic verse, others not without elision, if the i had
been kept long, and the Dactylic poets consequently short-
enedit in aocordance with the general rulo. Pl. and Ten,
however, to whose metros this would not apply, sometimes
kept it long3 thus 998 sternat, 843 steri, but in 587, 965,
996 stari

perfecta in -01, was long in the oldest writers, according
