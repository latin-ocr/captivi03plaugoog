›I'HE Marnas OF PLAUTUS. xxix

but also in other feetl, (iv) either anapaest or spondeo may,
and a spondae usually does, precede a tribrach in yth. On
the other hand (v) the tribrach is less common than in
Greek especially in the 7th foot (there are only about 20
examples in this play), while in the 4th it is exeeedingly
rare: examples may be found at 267, 393, 411.

The apparent introduction of feet which are foreign to
the metra, such as baoohii, cratim, ete, is to bo differently
explained (inf. ξ 136 sqq. ).

The Plautina scheme, then, is

67 The ictus metricus in trochaio metre falls upon the
first syllable of the feet, έν, buu, Α, bu, 1=v3
consequently the rule in iambica and anapaestics that
anapaest must not follow tribraeh or dactyl does not apply
to trochaice.

68 The octonarius or tetrameter aoat. was, like the lambio
oet, unknown to the Greeka who wrote the two halves
of the line separately as dimeters.

The same feet were admitted by the Romans as in the
septenarius, the trocheo and tribraoh alone being allowed
in the 8th ; but as tha last syllable of a verse is doubtful,
these feet are often replaced by spondeas and anapaesta.

At the end of the 4th foot diaeresis ocours and hiatus is
allowed.

¹ Proeeleusmaties are rarer and more objectionable in
trochaio than in lambio metre; in the latter, unless they are
preceded by a daetyl or tribraoh or followed by an anapaest
theletus recuro within three syllables, while in the former it
necessarily always requires four.
