both is designedly ambiguous, as Hegio is standing by,

provide him with money for the joumey and Tyndarus ’

9 The third Act is opened by Ergasilus who is on his
111, i, way from the market-plaoe to the harbour. This is, he
says, the most unfortunate day for him, the meenest and
most niggardly day that in his long experienoe he has
ever come across, and he would like to punoh its head.
He has tried to sorevv an invitation out of the young
men in the market-plaoe‚ but with one accord they heve ,
all refused to have anything to do with him. In the har-
bour he thinks he may possibly meet some new arrival
who in the joy of getting home may give him a dinner,

whelmed with the congratulatione of his fellowcitizens Ι

Philopolemus. He has then gone to a suburban farm
where several other Elean prisoners whom he had bought

111, ffi,ri1nning out in a stete of the greatest alerm. Aristo-

’ phontes willof course recognise him, and Hegio will then
discover how he has been deceived; he tries ιο hit upon
some device to avoid this, but his wita refuse to work and
he is interrupted by the appearance of Hegio and Aris·
