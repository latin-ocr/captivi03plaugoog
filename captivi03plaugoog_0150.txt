iu eo, hence the consec. subj, R. 1682. Before 155 nc. the
auditorium (cauea) ο1 a Roman theatre was merely a sloping
bank oi earth: in that year the censor Caesius began to build
astons theatro with tiers of seats or steps (acbsellla, aradus)
for the audienoe, but the senate on the motion ο1 Scipio Nasica
ordered its demolition and decreed ‘uc quis la urbe propiusue
passus mille subsellia praeisse sedensue ludos spectare uellcl‚’
Val. Max. 11. 4. 2; so that, as the epitome ο1 Livy says, bk 48,
aliquandiu populus statu ludos spectaret. Meanwhile provin-
cial towns like Tusculum and Faesulae, which were not so etriot
in their conservatism, had their etone theatres, and alter some
years the caueae in Roman theatres were filled with scats like
these, but made cf wood. Hence we find subsellia mentioned
in the prologuee (not by Pl.) to the Poenulus and Amphitruo.
But as we also find references to a sitting andience in the body
ο1 some of the plays (eg. Aul. 7191111111,Τιοο.αα]ῐο.)οε
may conclude thet the spectatore in the time ο1 Pl. either sat
cn the ground or brought scats or cuchions with them (as in
craece, Theophr. (lhar. 2). .
