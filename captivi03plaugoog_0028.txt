in the first foot of each dipodia, ie. in tho lst, 3rd and eth
feet: of. Hor. A„ P. 255

The spondeo hythe resolution of one of its long sylla·
bles into two short ones becomes either an anapaest or a
dactyl, both of which were admitted hythe Greek comio
dramatists in the odd feet (the dactyl rarely in 5th), while
the' anapaest appears also in 2nd and 4th. The anapaest,
however, is very rarely permitted in Greek comedy to
stand efter a tribraeh or a dsotyl

Thus the scheme oi Greek Comedy is

measure falls upon the latter part of the foot 22, -2,
and when the aucented long syllables are resolved into

two short, upon tho first of these two short: thus νύν,
- ⁴23 but ννέ. It will now bo seen why in Greek iambios

an anapaest never, or very seldom, follows a tribraoh
or daotyl (νύν Ι ⁹⁸², ordv l M); for that would give
four syllables from ictus to ictus, while the measure admits
at most three syllables to a foot.

45* Caesma is a division of the verso caused by the ending
of a word in the middle, and not et the end of a f00t;
in iambic trimeters (and dactylio hexameters) it is found
almost invariably in the third or fourth foot3 in the

after 2} feet (πενθημιμερής ‘of 5 halves’), in the latter
Hephthemimeral (ἔφθημιμερής ‘of 7 halves’). Both are
