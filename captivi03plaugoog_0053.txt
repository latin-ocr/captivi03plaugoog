xliv INTRODUOTIOM

(a) a short vowel u before another vowel is almost
, indistinguishable from a consonant u (pronounoed u);

teuuu, for instance, seems to have been, until after Vergil’s
time, always dissyllabic (teutria);

G. 11. 180 Tauuta ubi argilla et dumosis calculus aruir.
Aen. v. 432 Gener labant, uastos quatit ceper anhelitus artur.

So in this play du‘ellum 68, aut tut eto. frequently, flucae
638, functi 628, matta 197, and fuit (monosyllahle) often.

112 On the other hand in the early languageuwas treated ⁰
ae a vowel in many words in which it was afterwards
considered a consonant ; and this usage was occasion·

ally adopted by later poets as an intentional archaism.
Thus in Lucr. we find munuc, suadeat, reliquae, aquae,
soleio etc, in Hor. siluae, multae, in Catullus euolutam, etc.

In Pl. reliqrwa is always tetrasyllabic, and miluoa,
larua trisyllabic.

113 (b) Consonantal u (u) between two vowels is apt to

drop out and allow the two vowels to coalesco, asin
amasti inruerit uerit malo prudeus acta-3 udus iunior
mobilu incaveatum etc, for autauuti iustoeucrit acuerit
uuauolo prouidens aeuitur etc.

So ais (110) for ai uvir, sultis (456) ior ai uultis, du‘rutiis
(170), and perhaps iumentorum).

114 (c) Sometimes, however, the u forms a diphthong
with the preceding vowel, and a succeeding short vowel
drops out; thus fautor cautor curua auceps are shortened =
forms of fauctor cauitor nauita auicepe3 on this depende
the pun in Truc. 685, on'ceuillutor and caulis. Το the
same effect is the well-known story of Crassus (Cic. Div. Ἰ
11. 40. 84), who, embarking with his army for the ill-fated
Parthian expedition, met an itinerant fig-seller orying l
“Certumst'’ (so ficos, figs from Caunus in Asia). This,
says (licere, might have been taken as a waming3 being
apparently identieal in sound with cuueuccaa. So perhaps ἵ
