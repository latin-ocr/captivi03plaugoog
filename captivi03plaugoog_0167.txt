used with reference to a Roman magistrate, the aptore os

167. Schoell brackets this line; two objections to it ara
evideht: the uss. read Quod which makes nonsense, while
ii Quoi be read the construction is olumsy, at the least; again

a'dactyl is followed by an anapaest (Int. ξ 46, u), and the
acuent on Philopolemus ia unnatural (1195873). Quod obt.
was probably a gloss on prouinciam, expanded into a verse

by some unskilful hand. Most editors however retain the l

line, some explaining omnes quot obt. as equivalent to omnes
ut cuique obt, others referring quot to Philop. which follows.
Brix and Usa. attempt to avoid this difficulty by transposing
fugitaret...proutrwtom and postquem...tuoa‚ while m. escapes
the metrioal difficulty by reading poet Pb. quom ·

some similer words with which Erg. began his speech3 as for
instance ΗΕ. Noa pol mirandum. ER. Namque ad tarro
prouinciam... ,· but it is more probable that the whole passage

152-167 is an interpolation.

rto. musaraneus: nom. aarum, uto repam, re.
gener. Pl. uses the word again in Sti. 385. Lucr. uses the
form multigenas, -α, om.

opus est: the original meaning was ‘there is work to be
done with' hence the abl.; but asthis came to mean that the
thing in question ‘is needed? opus was also constructed with
the nom.. as in 164. Atterwards the word seems to have
acquired the meaning ‘need’ as it is used by Livy and later
wrliters with a gen. (R. 1225, 1226, 1255, 1256 end pref. to
vo.11.p. 7 ).
