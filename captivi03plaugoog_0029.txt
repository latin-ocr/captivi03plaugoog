are instanoes of the latter.

The ration dicre of a caesura seems to have been that
some division oi the line was necessary to relieve the
monotony of the rhythm, that thie division would naturally

be wanted about the middle of the line, but that if it
occurred esactly at the middle, ie. at the end of the :nd
foot, the result would have been to make two complete
lines of 3 leet each.

46 Such were the chief rules of the Greek comio iambie
trimeter; the Plautina usage was different in the following
respons:-

(i) he admitted thespondee, and occasionallythe deotyl,
in the ind and eth.

(ii) he very rarely puts a daotyl in tth; there nro but
six instanoes in the (lap.² 5, 53, 103, 514, 745, 747.

says that the final iambus is never preceded in Pl. by
an lambio word ora cretio word or a word ending in 1
cretio.

(iv) tribraohs are much less commen in all meires than

in Greek, three or more short syllables rarely oooiirring
consecutively in Latin.
