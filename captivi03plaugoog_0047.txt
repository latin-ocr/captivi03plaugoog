With regardtomonosyllahhmdingin-mitisrmbahle
(Gorssen Ausspr. 11. 790) that final m was much more dis·
tinotly heard in the time of Pl than afterwards1, and there-

fore, although hiatus would not be allowable after mono· ,
syllables ending in a short vowel, for they oould not be
shortened by it, it might be less objectionable after mono-
syllables ending with aa. Even Lueretius has

111. 1082 Sed tem Ι 8088188οά anemae, id exsuperare uidetur.

89 One other point is remarked by Ussing (Proh, p. 220);
that hiatus seemed to be considered an ornament rather

than a blemish when the two open vowels were the same²;
thus

Verg. G. 1. 281 Ter 8881 conati Ι imponere Petit! 088818.
Hor. Od. 1. 28. 24 Oasitae et capiti Ι inhumato.
11. 20. 13 Iam Daedaleo lacior Icaro.

This is the ease in Gap. 139, 182, 263, 354, 364, 374,
426, 823, 880, 866, 1006, 1016.

90 To sum up, hiatus ean only be admitted after these
monosyllabio and dissyllabis words, unless it ean be
aocounted for under one of the headings (A) or (B) : in all
other cases it must be attributed to some corruption in the
text Its comparative rareness would seem almost strange
in such conversational verse if we did not lmow on the
authority 81 Cicero that the Romans ware given to nmning
their vowels together in ordinary talk: 188 Latina linqua

¹ Quintilian, rx. 4. 40, says 81 final m beforeaword beginning
with a vowel, “neque enim eximitur sed obscuratur, et tantum
aliqua inter duas uocales uelut nota est, ne ipsae ooeant.''

⁹ Gellius, vu. 20, quotes several instantes from Homer.
