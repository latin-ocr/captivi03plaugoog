Orus oi these is prefixed to each oi the plays except the Bao-
chidea‚ the beginning oi which has been lost. They are con·
sidered from internal evidence to be the work oi a time long
subsequent to Plautus; moreover the idea oi an acrostio argu-
ment is evidently one which would occur only to a literary
student, and the plays oi Plautus were not studied as literature
until at least a century after his death. The form carrnwur is
here adopted chiefly, no doubt, to gain two extra lines ior the
explanationes the plot, but partly also on account ofits archaia
air. In inscriptions dating towards the end oi the republic nr

tor 1 is found but rarely, and much less frequently in nou·final
than in final syllables

'l'his is not the work oi Plautum it is assigned by Ritschl to
the middle ot the ist century nc„ when the plays oi Pl. were
revived on the Roman stage3 of. the prologue to the Casina:

Nos, postquam populi rumore intelleximus
studiose expetere uos Plautinas tabulas,
antiquam eius edidimus comoediam.

In the original play there was probably no prologus, the
necessary explanatione being given by the parasite Ergasilus
in a passage at 1. 94 which was afterwards cut out3 even as it
now stands some explanatione are given there for the second
time. The way in which this prologus was compiled from the
rest citha play may be seen by comparing the following lines:
4 with 96‚8 with 876 and 1011, 20 with 982 and 1013, alwith
93, 07 with 90 and 100, 28 with 101, 31 with 169 and 170, 33
with letand 160, 34 with 111, 43 with 686. .
