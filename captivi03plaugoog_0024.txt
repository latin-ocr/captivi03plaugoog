THE Marnas OF PLAUTUS. xv

THE METRES OF PLAUTL‘S.

31 The Greek system of versification‚ used ior the first
time in Latin by Livius Andronicus, who began to write
about the date of Plautus' birth, was based upon quantity,
ie. the length of time during which the voice dwells upon
the different syllables in a word. In ordinary speech there
is, of course, grean variety in this respect, but sor metrical
pin-poses the Greeks recognised only two varieties as
possible, and elassified all syllables as either short or long,
the short syllable containing one ‘time' (azoro, tempas),
the long syllable being taken as equal to two short and
so containing two ‘times’

32 The different combinations of two, three or four syl-
lables belonging to these two classes aie called feet, and

two consecutive feet are sometimes called a deposita.
33 Feet may bc classified according tc (a) the number of
syllables, or (b) the number oi ‘times' which they contain.

the Trisyllabic are
