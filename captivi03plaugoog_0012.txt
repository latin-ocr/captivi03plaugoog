PREFAOE.

In preparing the text 01 this edition I have
availed mysell 01 1100 invaluable apparatus 00111000 10
Professor Schoell's edition 01 the play (Leipzig, 1887),
as well as 01 the 0011011οο 01 V which he hes included
in his preiace 10 the 000100 (1890). From these two
sources I have compiled the short notes 01 00000011·
ings which are given 01 the 1001 01 each page 01 the
text 3 they include, Ι thinlr, all the important verie-
tions‚ and will 01 any rate enable the student to 000
01 0000 whether any particular reading in the text
has 00. authority or not; further than this it is in
my opinion inadvisable to go, in 0 boolr intended
primarily ira 00000 scholaram. The insertion 01
English stege directions in the text is intended to
avoid the necessity 100 longer explanatione in the
notes and to bring the scene more vividly before the
minde 01 younger studente. ' Ι

10 the Introduction Ι have devoted considerable

spece to 00 account 01 Plautine metre and prosody‚
in which I have tried to emphasize the fect-not
generally realized‚ 01 any rate by young studente-
that the versification 01 Ρ100100 10 001 0 thing apert,
either in its rules or its irregularities. The notes 00
scansion, which I have added 01 the ioot 01 each
pege 01 text, will I hope serve a double purpose;
