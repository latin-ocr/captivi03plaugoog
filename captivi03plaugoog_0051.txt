xlii INTRODUCTION.

103 ΙΙ, ῙΗΙ. Instenoes oi i before another vowel forming
one syllable with it aro usually to be explained by the i
being treated as a consonant 11 10910111 where the second
vowel is another 1 contractior probably takes place Thus
Hor. Ep. 1. 1. llindiciir fruar lisdem, Verg. Aen. w. 269
enimsi tempora 1111111111 so in ordinary speech proriis was
contracted to pratis, audiisse to 1111111111,ηὲὴί nibil to nri nil,
etc.; dii, ii are probably always contracted in the early poete.

104 OI, OHI. huor. 1. 976 quod probibeat efficiatque, Verg.
Aen. 111. 383 prvtnde tono, and proinde probably always in good
writers. In this play we have probibate 804, prato always.

105 Perhaps the scansion of eins, haias, quoius as mono-
syllables is due to synaeresis, the a coalesoing with the
previous diphthong er‘ 111011 instanoes are

Luor.1. 139 Principiam 101111 binc nobis exordia sumet.
Cic. Aret. Atque 11111 ipsc manet relipatar corpore torto.

11111111 play we have ewa 107, 289, 0211139, 641, 800,
111οΤ111 106, as well as other instances which may be ex-
plained by apocope of the final s.

10ss The scansion of aio is peculisr: the original form
was cri-io (so written by Oia, according to Quint 1. 4. 11; 1
iu Trin. caaithas alietas, in 642 maiiorea, ln 201 pai-
iara'ns), but the first a' was usually dropped both in writing 1
and pronunciation, the a being either shortened or taken as
adiphthong with the following i; ag. either dit (Cap. 692 1
613) or Mt (Cap. 567, 979); sometimes, however, the original
length of the first syllable is preserved, as in aa 01111365,
dia Am. 284, As 901. With regard to the imperfect, ¹
the MSS. always have the rmoontracted form arabon,
etc.; but often the matre shows the scansion to be d'tbnm3
asin (lap. 661, ·

Mero. ost 01111111 erret tn parentinus. 0911111111 citeriori tticum,
804 Rus abiisse aibant. Nunc 0111111111 tentatio.

On the other hand, the longer form is required in Gap.
