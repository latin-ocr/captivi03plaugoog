‘ Tragedy. Hence that part cf the foci which receives the
ι ictus was originally called the θέσις, for there the reciter
put down his hand or his foot, while the part which ia free
from the ictus was called the ἄρσις, forthere helifted it up.
This was the usage of the older grammarians Dionysius
and Hephaesti0; but later writers, such as Priscian and
Martianus Capella (ιιι century an), thinking that these
terms referred ιο the voice and noticing that stress is laid
upon a syllable by raising the voice not by lowering it, ·
reversed the practice of their predecessore and called that
part of the foot which received the ictus the ἄρσις and the
other the θέσις; and this usage is now so well established
that any attempt ιο return to the ancient practice would
ordy lead to confusion. The words will therefore be used
here in the later and less correct way, as referring ιο the
voice, that part of the foot upon which the stress is laid
· being called the ἄρσις or said ιο be iu arai, while the other
part is called the θέσις or said ιο be iu theri.

41 In an iambus, anapaest or bacchius the stress falls upon
the final long syllable ; in a trochee, cretic or dactyl upon
the initial long syllable. And so with the measures of
which these are the original feet; in the Iambic Anapaestic
and Bacchiac measures the ictus falls on the latter part of
the foot whether it be the proper fcot of the measure or
any other foot which may be substituted therefor, while

in Tracheia Oretic and Dactylic it falls on the first part
42 Thus there are two distinct and opposite kinds of verse,
that in which the feet begin with the thecia (rising rhythm),

and that in which they begin with the arcta (falling
rhythm). We will consider first the rising rhythms.

was the iambus, for which the equivalent tribrach was
