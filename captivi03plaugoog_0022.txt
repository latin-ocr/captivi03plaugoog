THE MANUSORIPTS OF PLAUTUS. xiii

for the most part correotly divided and the contractioris are
not many or diffioult. There is no division into acts;
spaoes were left by the original copyists for the headings

these have been subsequently filled in. In many of the
plays corrections have been made by various hands.

written in capital letters without any division between
