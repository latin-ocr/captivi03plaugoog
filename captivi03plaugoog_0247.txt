this passage, implies that the lambs are fat and fit for hilling3
and locare e. agnos apparently meana to eontraot to hand over
sueh lamba, the conductor intending to saorifiee them first and
eet them afterwards (666611 862).

duplam agninam: this, the uss. reading, must be taken to
mean 11161 the purehaser finds, when the animal arrives, that
116 has twice as much lamb (agnino 66. earo) as he bargained
for, ie. that it isa full grown sheep. This at any rate agrees
with the next line and would mehe good sense if 11166616
were by weight. Most editors however adopt Rost's emenda·
tion dupla (se. pecnnia), ‘at double the proper priee'; but the
repetition agnos...e9nine would be very awkward, while the
plarasite would naturally eare about the quality but not about
t 661166.
