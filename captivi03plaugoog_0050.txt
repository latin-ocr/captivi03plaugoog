96 Here may be noticed the peculiarity of scansion by
which the final syllable of a word ending in r sometimes
coalescas with afollowing cs or cat; thus we have spectitat
(mperatrlis eat) in 518, saecat in 295, ocatam’a in 183,
uincet in Pers 267, etc.

common.

97 Under this head come peculiarities of scansion which
arise (i) by synaeresis, (ii) by syncope, (iii) owing to the
double character of the vowel and consonanti and (iv) ol
the vowel and consonant a. lt must be borne in mind
that these were popular pronunciatione, not arbitrary
changes introduced by the poets metri pratia.

98 (i) Synceresis is the contractiori of vowels (consecutive
or separated by an Ιι), which properly form separate syl-
lables in the same word, so as to form one syllable (cf. Cic.
Orat. 44. 150 quoted in ξ 90); thus we have
