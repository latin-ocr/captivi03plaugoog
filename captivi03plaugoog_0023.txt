xiv INTBODUOTION.
311113. Of the Captiai only a few fragments of two passages

remain (905-931, loca-1029). An elaborate edition of
this MS. by Studemund has recently been published
(Berlin, 1690).

28 In addition to these four MSS, ABOD, there are three
or four others which require notice, although of secondary
importanoe. V is a cursivo Ma, dating from the begin-
ning of the 12th century, in the University Library at
Leyden. Doubtlees it originally contained the first eight
plays, but its beginning and ond have been mutilated and
it now comprises the Aniciana (190—end), Captiui, Oar-
oalio, Casina, Cistellaria and Epidicvs (to 244). An account
of it may be found in Schoell's preface to hie edition of
the Carina. E is aoursive MS. of the 13th century, and
contains the first eight plays. J, which is preserved in
the British Museum, dates from the beginning of the 12th
century. lt is a MS. of 194 leaves, of which the first 112
contain three treatises of Cicero, the remainder the first
eight plays of Pl. lt has been damaged by fire, and the
beginnings and ends of lines are often illegible.

29 These three MSS. are considered to have had a common
archetype, belonging to the same family as B and D and
related to both of them in the same way as they are related
to each other; to this archetypo V corresponds most closely,
then 63 the authority of J being reckoned lower than
that of the other twa. These MSS. are obviously of velue
to supplement B in those plays (including the last half
of the Coptica) where neitherO nor D is availabla How
they agree, in reproducing errore in which their archetype
differed from B and D may be seen in the critical notes on
unes 33, oo, 161, 174, 333, 433, 433, 433, 333, 616, 313, 313,
111, 334, 311, 333, 331, 333, 1333.

30 A fragment of the Captiai (400-655) is contained in
a MS. (Ο) which Loewe considers of the same age as D;
it is transcribed in Goetz's Analecta Plautina, p. 86 sqq.
