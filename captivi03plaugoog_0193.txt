' Rome in early times the only doctors were Greek freedmen or
eleves from Sicily end Magna Graecia (there was a famous
medical school at Croton, Hdt. 111. 131); such freedmen would
be clientes oi their former masters, and any Greek phyeician
eettling in Rome would also voluntarily seek the protection of

some poweriul citizen.
