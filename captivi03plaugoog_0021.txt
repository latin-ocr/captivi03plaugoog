21 At the beginning of the leth century only the first
eight plays, so understood, were known to exist3 the last
twelve had been lost. But in 1428 6 MS. was discovered
in Germany which comprised not only the Am, Aa, Aut,
and half the Captict (to 503), hut also the missing twelve.
This MS. (now known as D) was brought to Rome and
passed into the hands of Oardinal Orsini, after whom it
is named the Codex Ursinianus3 by him it was placed in
the Vatioan Library, where it now is. Itis a'cursive MS.
of German origin dating from the llth century, written
by the same hand throughout ; the lines are generally run
together and the words are often wrongly divided.

22 Various transcripte were made of it, but, as every tran-
scriber emended as he went along and aimed at giving an
intelligible text rather than an accurate copy, the inter-

23 The edita princeps (quoted by Ritschl as Z) was pub
lished at Venice in 1472 by Georgius Merula; he was
dependent to a greum extent upon interpolated copies of D.

24 In the middle of the 16th century Camerarius of
Leipsio obtained possession of two other MSS. previously
unknown, B and O, upon which he founded his edition
(Lips. 1552); after his death they were purchased end
placed in the Palatino Library, and subsequently removed
to the Vatican. B still remains there, O was transferred ¹
in 1797 to Paris, and in 1815 to Heidelberg, where it still is.

25 B, the Codex Vetus Camerarii,is a cursive MS. of
the llth century, containing all the plays and oc'oupying
213 folio sheets. It is irregularly written by different
hands, but, speaking generally (for the execution of the
different parts varies considerably), the lines and words are
