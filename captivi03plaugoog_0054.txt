115 Some scholare have maintained that contractiori in
the writings of Pl. was far from being confined within
the above limita Prof. Remsay, for instance, considered
that most of the difficulties of Plautina scansion were to
be explained by a species cf contractiori, or ‘correption,'
which consisted in running two syllables into one. Among
the examples which he gives¹ are the following :- tibi ab,

· want, quid doc, quod omncs, quid a, epo ricta, quid tu inter,
which he supposes to have been proncunced tb' ab, ucat,
qud froc or quid lic, quod ’maes qud a, cp' 'atra perid ι’ 'uteru
But this theory is open to many objections3 among othere,
that it would lead to the confusion of similar words, that
when two monosyllables were thus run together, it would
leave one of thern formless and unrecognisable; and that
it would produce collocatione of consonante unknown to
Latin and, one would think, beyond the power of the
human tongue to proncunce. The instances which are
given in support of it are susceptible cf another and a far
more probable explanation (cf. inf. ξ 136 sqq.).

The remaining points in which Pl. scansion differs from
that of the Augustan poets are two: vowels which are
scanned short by the latter are sometimes long in Pl, and

vowels long by nature or position are sometimes scanned ⁸
short in Pl.

11ss The tendency tc reduce the effert of articulatim, which
has been already mentioned, acts most strongly upon un· ν
accented syllables, and as the final syllable in Latin was
always unacoenredss, it naturally suffered most from this ,

¹ Intr. to Mostellaria, p. c.-cvi. ’

² The accent referred to is not the ictus metricus but the
secent of ordinary speech, which in Latin did not ,differ much
from the English practice; see R. bk 1. ch. 13.
